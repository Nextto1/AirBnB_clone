Description of AirBnB clone

This is the initial step towards building full web application.
It is composed by:
1.A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface
Typical example is the way the Simple shell operates
2.A website (the front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic
3.A database or files that store data (data = objects)
4.An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them)
