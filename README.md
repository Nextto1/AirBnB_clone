    A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface
Typical example is the way the Simple shell operates
A website that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic
A database or files that store data that is data = objects
An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end

Command Interpreter

# The command interpreter, called console.py, provides a
# text-based interface for interacting with the program.
# It supports other commands for managing different
# classes, including State, City, Amenity, Place, Review, and User.

Starting the Command Interpreter

# To initiate the command interpreter, run the command below in your terminal:

# ./console.py


# The command interpreter supports the following commands:

# Creating a new instance of a specified class and saves it to the JSON file.

# Showing details of a specific instance by class name and instance ID.

# Removing  an instance by class name and instance ID.

# Showing details of all instances or all instances of a specific class.

# Updating the attributes of an instance by class name and instance ID.

Examples

# Creating a new User:

# create User email

# Showing details of a User

# Destroying a Place

# Listing all instances

# Updating the name of a City
